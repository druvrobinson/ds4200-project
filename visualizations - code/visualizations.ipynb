    "* Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "• Best suited for Altair. Its declarative syntax makes it easy to create a color-coded matrix with built-in tooltips and interactive filtering (such as highlighting key correlations).\n",
    "• Outcome: A clear, interactive heatmap where hovering over cells reveals exact correlation values, helping to pinpoint the strongest predictors of exam scores.\n",
    "​\n",
    "* Box Plot\n",
    "• Also a great candidate for Altair. It can efficiently render distributions and provide interactive features like hover details for outliers and summary statistics.\n",
    "• Outcome: An intuitive view comparing exam score distributions across categories (e.g., varying levels of parental involvement), enabling users to quickly assess group differences.\n",
    "​\n",
    "* Scatter Plot\n",
    "• Altair is excellent here too. It easily supports interactive elements like zoom, pan, and hover tooltips to reveal precise data points (e.g., study hours versus exam scores).\n",
    "• Outcome: A responsive scatter plot that may even include trend lines or regression details, allowing users to explore the relationship between continuous variables effectively.\n",
    "​\n",
    "* Bar Chart\n",
    "• For a straightforward static or lightly interactive chart (comparing, for example, average exam scores by gender or school type), Altair is both quick and efficient.\n",
    "• Alternatively, if you want to add advanced interactivity (like dynamic sorting, filtering by clicking on bars, or linking with other visualizations), implementing this chart within a D3.js environment can yield richer interactions.\n",
    "• Outcome: A clear bar chart that either remains static for simplicity or becomes a part of a more interactive suite, depending on design choices.\n",
    "​\n",
    "* Interactive Dashboard\n",
    "• This is where D3.js truly shines. D3 provides extensive customization and seamless interactivity, which is ideal for integrating multiple charts.\n",
    "• Outcome: A comprehensive dashboard that links several visualizations (such as the scatter plot, box plot, and bar chart) so that filtering or selections in one chart update the others in real time. This enhances user engagement and deepens insight exploration."
